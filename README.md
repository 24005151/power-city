## Expanded Algorithm Description

The algorithm for the Power City Simulation is divided into the following major steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set up default values for capacities (hydro, solar, wind, and battery).
   - Initialize battery health, charge cycles, and grid cost.

2. **Weather Simulation**:
   - Simulate temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation using seasonal and diurnal patterns.
   - Incorporate random variations to mimic real-world unpredictability.

3. **Energy Usage Calculation**:
   - Base energy usage adjusted for temperature extremes:
     - Higher usage in cold temperatures (heating).
     - Higher usage in hot temperatures (cooling).

4. **Energy Production Calculation**:
   - **Hydroelectricity**: Dependent on water flow, turbine capacity, and efficiency.
   - **Solar Power**: Based on solar radiation, panel efficiency, and maximum capacity.
   - **Wind Power**: Using wind speed, turbine efficiency, and capacity constraints.

5. **Battery Management**:
   - Update battery level based on net energy (generation - usage).
   - Handle charge cycles and degrade battery health over time.

6. **Grid Dependency**:
   - If renewable generation is insufficient or the battery is depleted:
     - Draw energy from the grid and calculate associated costs.

7. **Cost Savings**:
   - Compare renewable energy contributions against grid costs to calculate savings.

8. **Data Visualization**:
   - Real-time graphs for energy usage, generation, and battery levels.
   - Text logs for system updates and metrics.

9. **Report Generation**:
   - Aggregate data into daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reports for analysis.

10. **User Interaction**:
    - Allow users to toggle energy sources, update capacities, and adjust grid costs dynamically.
